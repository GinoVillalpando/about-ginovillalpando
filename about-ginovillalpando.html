 <h1> About Gino Villalpando</h1>
  <p> To keep things simple and general I'm a big technology nerd and avid fan of opera. I love to build computer and understand how other software works and their settings.
  My ultimate dream is to create and patent new technology for opera houses around the world.
  Currently, I love working with Adobe programs for editing videos, images or rendering graphics into both videos and images.
  Another thing I love to do on my computer is live streaming my sugargliders on Twitch and watching endless videos of Korean Kimchi Mukbang Those are just some facts about me, Gino Villalpando
